# CMSC 115 Unit 1 Lab

## Learning Objectives

- Run, test, and edit a Java class
- Use single-line and multi-line (block) comments
- Declare, initialize, and update a variable.
- Use numeric operators in calculations.
- Use the debugger to step through a program one line at a time.
- Use the debugger to visualize variable initialization and reassignment in memory.
- Use a `Scanner` to read user input.
- Identify and fix syntax and logic errors

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to effectively run, test, and edit
a Java class while mastering a variety of core programming concepts.
You'll explore how to use both single-line and multi-line comments
for documentation and clarity. The lab will show you how to declare,
initialize, and update variables, as well as apply numeric operators
in calculations. You'll also gain hands-on experience with using the
debugger to step through a program, visualize variable changes in memory,
and track variable initialization and reassignment. Additionally,
you'll discover how to use the `Scanner` class to read user input,
and learn how to identify and fix common syntax and logic errors. By the end
of this lab, you'll have a deeper understanding of Java programming
fundamentals and debugging techniques. 

## IntelliJ Interactive Development Environment

**Note:** Instructions for accessing IntelliJ on Mars and installing IntelliJ on your local machine can be found in a separate document.

IntelliJ is a robust interactive development environment (IDE). The user interface consists of a project view on the left that lists files and folders, and an editor on the right where the contents of opened files are displayed. When you run a program, the output appears in the run view at the bottom of the window.

<img alt="IntelliJ IDE project, editor, and run views" src="images/IDE_views.png" width="500">

You can adjust the size of the various views as needed. For instance, if you need more space for the editor, you can close the project view. To toggle the visibility of the project view, click the folder button in the activity sidebar, or navigate to *View > Tool Windows > Project* from the top menu.

<img alt="project folder button in activity sidebar" src="images/project_folder.png" width="150">

For now, ensure the project view is visible. The CMSC 115 Unit#1 lab files are located in the *src > main >* java folder.

For additional information about IntelliJ, including how to customize the appearance and accessibility settings, refer to the links in the resources section at the bottom of this lab.

## Task 1 - CourseWelcome

Let's examine a simple Java program that prints a greeting. A Java class with a `main` method represents an executable program.

```java
public class CourseWelcome {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome to CMSC 115.");
        System.out.println("Let's learn Java!");
    }
}
```

Double-click on `CourseWelcome` in the project view to open the file in the editor.

<img alt="double click in project view to open a Java file in editor" src="images/open_java_in_editor.png" width="400" >

This code defines a Java class called `CourseWelcome`. Inside the class, the `main` method is implemented, which is the entry point of a Java program. The `main` method contains two `System.out.println` statements that print the following text to the console:

```text
Welcome.
Let's learn Java!
```

When the program is executed, these two lines of text will be displayed on the screen.

### Run CourseWelcome

There are several ways to run the `main` method.

1. Click the green run arrow to the left of the class header or the main method.
2. Right-click in the editor window and select **Run CourseWelcome.main()**.
3. Right-click on  `CourseWelcome` in the project view and select **Run CourseWelcome.main()**.
4. Select **Current File** and then click the green run arrow in the project toolbar.
5. Select **Run > Run CourseWelcome** from the top menubar.

<img alt="ways to run a main method" src="images/run.png" width="500" >

Experiment with the different ways to run the `CourseWelcome` class. Confirm the following two lines of output are produced.

```text
Welcome.
Let's learn Java!
```


### Run CourseWelcomeTest

The current code produces the text shown in the **Actual Output** column below.
However, assume the code should produce the text in the **Expected Output**
column.

| Expected Output           | Actual Output |
| ------------------------ |---------------|
| Welcome to CMCS 115.<br>Let's learn Java! | Welcome.<br>Let's learn Java!|


Many of the tasks you'll do will involve writing
a program to produce some expected output. For each task, 
you need to test the program to check the output.

We'll use a very popular testing framework named Junit. For each regular Java class,
we use a separate Junit class to test the functionality.

- Java class `CourseWelcome`
- Junit test class `CourseWelcomeTest`

Expand the test folder in the project view as shown in the screenshot below.
The test folder contains a Junit test class for each regular Java class.

<img alt="CourseWelcomeTest junit test class" src="images/junit.png" width="400" >

The `CourseWelcomeTest` Junit class has a method that checks the output
produced when the `CourseWelcome` class is executed. Don't worry about
understanding the code in the Junit test class. We'll learn how to write
Junit tests in a later lesson.  For now, you'll just run the test to check the result.

1. Right-click on `CourseWelcomeTest` in the project view, then select **Run CourseWelcomeTest**.<br>
<img alt="Run junit test class" src="images/run_test.png" width="300" >

2. The Run View will display a message indicating the test failed.  Click on <u>&lt;Click to see difference&gt;</u>. A side-by-side comparison is displayed highlighting the difference between the expected and actual output.<br>
<img alt="Test failed message in run view" src="images/test_failed.png" width="400" >

3. Close the comparison failure tab. You can click on the `CourseWelcome` tab in the editor if you don't see the code.

4. Update the `CourseWelcome` class to produce the expected output. The first print statement in the `main` method should print the character string
   "Welcome to CMCS 115.".<br>
<img alt="Task1 print statement corrected" src="images/task1_solution.png" width="400" >

5. Re-run the Junit `CourseWelcomeTest` class and confirm the test passed.<br>
<img alt="Test passed message in run view" src="images/test_passed.png" width="400" >


Congratulations on successfully passing your first Java coding task!  

## Task 2 - Comments

Java comments can be used to help explain the code. A comment can also prevent
one or more lines of code from executing.

- Line comment: Text following `//` is ignored on the current line.
- Block or multi-line comment: Text between `/*` and `*/` is ignored.

Double-click on the Java class named `Comments` to open the file in the editor, then run the program to
view the output.

```java
/**
 * Comments class - demonstrate different types of Java comments.
 *
 * @Author first last
 */
public class Comments {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("apple");

        //System.out.println("orange");

        System.out.println("pear");  //End of line comment

        /*
        System.out.println("lemon");
        System.out.println("banana");
         */

        System.out.println("watermelon");

        System.out.println("peach");
    }
}
```

- A line comment `//` prevents the statement that prints "orange" from executing.
- A block comment `/* */` prevents the two statements that print "lemon" and "banana"
  from executing.
- The print statement for "pear" executes because `//` appears _after_ the statement, which ends with a semicolon.

| Expected Output                     | Actual Output                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| apple<br>pear<br>watermelon<br><br> | apple<br>pear<br>watermelon<br>peach |


Notice the expected output does not include "peach".

1. Right-click on the Junit class `CommentsTest` in the project view, then select **Run CommentsTest**. You should see a message in the run view indicating the test failed.  Click to see the difference between the expected and actual output.<br>

<img alt="Task2 test fails" src="images/task2_fail.png" width="400" >

2. Update the `Comments` class to produce the expected output by adding `//` to comment out the last print statement (don't delete it!). 

```text
     //System.out.println("peach");
```

3. Re-run the Junit class `CommentsTest` to confirm the test passed.


### JavaDoc

The `Comments` class contains a special type of block comment before the class
header called a _JavaDoc_ comment. A Javadoc comment has an extra asterisk at
the beginning `/**` and ends with `/`. For example:

```java
/**
 * Comments class - demonstrates different types of Java comments.
 *
 * @Author first last
 */
```

JavaDoc is used to generate documentation in HTML format from Java source code.
We'll learn more about JavaDoc in a later lesson, but it is a good idea to
comment each class and method, and use special tags such as `@Author`.

## Task 3 - Fixit

Open the Java class named `Fixit` in the editor. 

```java
public class Fixit {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("ship");
        //System.out.println("airplane")
        System.out.println("tank");
    }
}
```

| Expected Output          | Actual Output        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| ship<br>airplane<br>tank | ship<br>tank<br><br> |

Run the program to see the output. The second print statement is commented out, so the program doesnâ€™t produce the expected result.

In Java, every statement must end with a semicolon. Notice that the first and third print statements have a semicolon at the end of the line, but the commented-out second print statement does not.

Remove the comment characters `//` from the second print statement.  

```java
System.out.println("airplane")
```


Notice the editor window displays a red warning symbol at the end of the line where the semicolon should be. You may also see a red warning icon at the beginning of the line of code.  If you click the warning or hover over the error , you'll see a message about the missing semicolon.
If you run the program, you'll see an error message displayed in the run view.  The program can't run because of the missing semicolon.

<img alt="Compiler warning for missing semicolon" src="images/error.png" width="400" >

Let's fix the syntax error so the program can execute.

1. Add a semicolon to the end of the print statement to fix the syntax error.
2. Run `Fixit` to see the output.
3. Run the Junit class `FixitTest` and confirm the test passes.


## Task 4 - PrintNewline

Open the Java class named `PrintNewline`.

```java
public class PrintNewline {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("red ");
        System.out.print("green ");
        System.out.println("blue ");
        System.out.print("pink ");
        System.out.println("yellow");
    }

}
```

- `System.out.println`: Appends a newline character. Subsequent output appears
  on the next line.
- `System.out.print` : Does not append a newline character. Subsequent output
  appears on the same line.

| Expected Output                        | Actual Output                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| red <br>green blue <br>pink <br>yellow | red <br>green blue <br>pink yellow<br><br> |

Run `PrintNewline` to view the output. In the expected output, "yellow" appears on
a separate line from "pink". Let's fix the program to produce the expected
output:

1. Edit the code so a newline character is appended after printing "pink".
2. Run `PrintNewline` to view the output.
3. Run `PrintNewlineTest` to confirm the test passes.

## Task 5 - MathExpression

Open the class named `MathExpression`.

```java
public class MathExpression {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("2 + 3 * 8 = ");
        System.out.println(2 + 3 * 8);
    }
}
```

A `String` is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes. An unquoted
arithmetic expression evaluates to a numeric value.

| Expression      | Value           |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| "2 + 3 \* 8 = " | "2 + 3 \* 8 = " |
| 2 + 3 \* 8      | 26              |

Run `MathExpression` to view the output. Assume we would like to evolve the
program to produce the expected output shown below:

| Expected Output   | Actual Output   |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| (2 + 3) \* 8 = 40 | 2 + 3 \* 8 = 26 |

1. Adjust the 2 print statements to produce the expected output. You need to add
   parenthesis in both the string and the math expression to force `+` to be
   performed before `*`.
2. Run `MathExpression` to confirm the expected output.
3. Run `MathExpressionTest` to confirm the test passes.

## Task 6 - Variables

Open the class named `Variables`.

```java
public class Variables {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "Silas";
        System.out.println("Hello " + name);

        int age = 28;
        System.out.println("You are " + age + " years old.");

        //TODO: Declare and assign gpa to 3.8.  Print a message showing the gpa.

    }
}
```

Run the program to view the output. 

```text
Hello Silas
You are 28 years old.
```

- A **variable** is a name associated with a memory location.
- A **variable declaration** allocates memory to store a value of a specified type.
- A **variable assignment** stores a value in the variable's memory location.

Java requires a variable to be declared **before** it can be assigned a value. A
variable declaration must specify a data type such as `int` or `double` or `String`, along
with the name of the variable. Once a variable is declared, it can be assigned an
initial value. The declaration and initialization can be done in one statement
or two as shown below.

| One Statement                        | Two Statements                                            |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| int age = 28; //declare & initialize | int age; &nbsp; &nbsp;//declare<br>age = 28; //initialize |

If you look carefully at the output, you'll see each print statement displays the text contained in the double quotes, followed by
the value assigned to the corresponding variable.  The plus character `+` is used to concatenate the quoted string and the variable value.


<img alt="String concatenation in print statement" src="images/concatenation.png" width="300" >

1. Update the `Variables` class to declare a third variable named `gpa` whose type is double and value is 3.8. Add a print statement to display the value. <br>
```java
        double gpa = 3.8;
        System.out.println("Your gpa is " + gpa);
```
2. Run `Variables` to confirm the output.<br>
```text
Hello Silas
You are 28 years old.
Your gpa is 3.8
```
3. Run `VariablesTest` to confirm the test passes.

## Task 7 - Paycheck

Open the class named `Paycheck`.

```java
/**
 * Paycheck class - debugging sample to demonstrate variables in memory
 * @author First Last
 */
public class Paycheck {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //Declare and initialize variables
        double hourlyRate = 18.25;
        int hoursWorked = 35;
        double pay = hoursWorked * hourlyRate;

        //Print initial values
        System.out.println("Week#1 hours: " + hoursWorked + " rate: $" + hourlyRate + " pay: $" + pay);

        //Assign hoursWorked to 39, recalculate pay
        hoursWorked = 39;
        pay = hoursWorked * hourlyRate;

        //Print updated values
        System.out.println("Week#2 hours: " + hoursWorked + " rate: $" + hourlyRate + " pay: $" + pay);

        //TODO: Week 3 - Assign hoursWorked to 27, increase hourlyRate by 0.50, recalculate pay

        //TODO: Print updated values

    }
}
```

Execute the program and view the output.

```text
Week#1 hours: 35 rate: $18.25 pay: $638.75
Week#2 hours: 39 rate: $18.25 pay: $711.75
```

A variable is declared only once within a block such as a method body. However,
it can be assigned a value several times.

Let's use the debugger to step through the program one line of code at a time.
Debugging shows how variables are declared, initialized, and updated in memory.

<table>

<tr>
<td>
<img src = "images/breakpoint.png" alt="click in line 9 gutter to set breakpoint" width=300>
</td>
<td>
Set a breakpoint at line 9 by clicking in the gutter to the left of the line number.<br>  A breakpoint is indicated by a red circle.  You can remove a breakpoint by clicking on it again.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<img src = "images/start_debugger.png" alt="debug button on menubar" width=200>
</td>
<td>
There are several ways to start the debugger:<br>
- Click the green arrow by the class header, then select <b>Debug Paycheck.main()</b>.<br> 
- Right-click in the code editor, then select <b>Debug Paycheck.main()</b>.<br>
- Select "Current File" and then press the Debug icon in the toolbar.<br>
- Select <b>Run > Debug Paycheck.main</b> from the main menubar.<br>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

The main method is called and stops execution at the breakpoint, i.e. line 9. If
the program doesn't stop at line 9, you might not have set the breakpoint.

<img src = "images/debug_perspective.png" alt="debug perspective" width=600>

- Line 9 is highlighted, indicating the current line of execution.
- The **variables view** will display variables stored in memory.
- The run view displays new buttons to control the debugging session.

<img src = "images/debug_controls.png" alt="debug perspective" width=200>

Let's use the "Step Over" button to execute one line of code at a time and
observe how each statement impacts the variables stored in memory.

</table>

Now that you've seen how variables are initialized and updated in memory, update
the `main` method as follows:

- Add statements to update `hoursWorked` and `hourlyRate` and recalculate `pay`
  for week#3.
- Print the updated variable values. The expected output is displayed below:

```text
Week#1 hours: 35 rate: $18.25 pay: $638.75
Week#2 hours: 39 rate: $18.25 pay: $711.75
Week#3 hours: 27 rate: $18.75 pay: $506.25
```

- Run `Paycheck` and confirm the expected output. Use the debugger to find and fix
any errors.
- Run `PaycheckTest` to confirm the tests passed.

Aside from visualizing variables in memory, you can use the debugger to
step through your code to find logic errors. 

Debugging is **one of the most
useful skills** you can acquire as a software developer!

## Task 8 - Rectangle

Open the class named `Rectangle`.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * Rectangle class - demonstrate initializing variables from console input
 *
 * @author First Last
 */
public class Rectangle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declare and initialize Scanner for reading input from console
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Prompt for length and width
        System.out.print("Enter length and width: ");

        // Declare width and initialize from the console input
        double length = input.nextDouble();

        // Declare width and initialize from the console input
        double width = input.nextDouble();

        // TODO: Declare area and initialize using width and height

        // TODO: Update to also print area
        System.out.println("length=" + length + " width=" + width);

    }
}
```

The program uses a `Scanner` to read user input and initialize the `length` and
`width` variables of a rectangle.

When you run the `Rectangle` class, the program displays the prompt "Enter
length and width: " and then waits until you enter two double values in the
terminal window.

<img src="images/console_input.png" alt="enter user input in the terminal window" width="200">

The program should calculate and print the length, width, and area of the
rectangle. However, it only prints the length and width.

| Expected Input/Output                                                    | Actual Input/Output                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enter length and width: <b>4.5 3.0</b><br>length=4.5 width=3.0 area=13.5 | Enter length and width: <b>4.5 3.0</b><br>length=4.5 width=3.0 |

1. Update the `main` method to declare a double variable named `area`. Calculate the
   area using the width and length that the user provided as input. Update the print statement to display
   the length, width, and area as shown in the expected output.<br>
2. Run `Rectangle` several times, passing different input values for length and
   width.
3. Run the Junit `RectangleTest` class to confirm the tests pass.

| Sample Run#1                                                             | Sample Run#2                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Enter length and width: <b>4.5 3.0</b><br>length=4.5 width=3.0 area=13.5 | Enter length and width: <b>10.25 2.5</b><br>length=10.25 width=2.5 area=25.625 |
