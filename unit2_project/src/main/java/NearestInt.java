/**
 * The {@code NearestIntSolution} class demonstrates how to round a fraction to its nearest integer
 * and handle both positive and negative values. It also shows how to cast a fractional number
 * to an integer and round it in different ways.
 *
 * <p>The program takes two integers from the user (numerator and denominator) to create a fraction,
 * then performs the following operations:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Calculate the double value of the fraction.</li>
 *     <li>Cast the double value to an integer.</li>
 *     <li>Round the value to the nearest integer (for both positive and negative values).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>It outputs the fraction, the double value, the integer value (casted), and the rounded integer values for both positive and negative cases.</p>
