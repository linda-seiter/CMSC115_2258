 *
 * <p>The program prompts the user to enter the initial reproduction number (r0), and then
 * it computes and displays the number of new cases on the fourth iteration based on the formula:
 * new cases = r0^4.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note: This model assumes that the basic reproduction number remains constant across iterations.</p>
