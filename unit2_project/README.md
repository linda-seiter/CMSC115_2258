# CMSC 115 Unit 2 Programming Projects

### Learning Objectives

1. Apply arithmetic operations, such as multiplication, division, and addition, in real-world programming scenarios.
2. Use built-in Java methods, like `Math.pow()`, to perform mathematical calculations and how to cast between data types (e.g., `double` to `int`).
3. Use the `Scanner` class to read input from the user and printing formatted output to the console.
4. Gain experience in handling and processing user input for real-world applications, including working with both integers and floating-point numbers.
5. Enhance problem-solving and debugging skills by working through various tasks that require logic and the use of appropriate operators for different types of computations.

### Introduction

In this unit's programming assignment, you will complete several tasks that involve practical Java programming concepts such as mathematical operations, input/output handling, and working with variables. These tasks are designed to improve your understanding of Java fundamentals and enhance your problem-solving abilities.

The tasks will also help you apply mathematical functions and work with both integer and floating-point numbers in real-world scenarios. By the end of this assignment, you will have experience in implementing basic calculations, formatting output, and running unit tests to verify your solutions.

Throughout this assignment, you will use a variety of operators to solve each task. You will also practice running unit tests to ensure the correctness of your code.

## Task 1 - TransmissionRate

**Objective**: Simulate the spread of a virus using the concept of the transmission rate (Râ‚€) and calculate the number of new cases after several iterations.

R<sub>0</sub> (pronounced R-naught) is a number that refers to the transmission
rate of a given virus. If R<sub>0</sub> is 5, then 1 person is capable of
spreading to 5 other persons on average.

The table below shows the number of new cases after various iterations of viral
spread:

<table>
<tr>
<th>R0</th>
<th>Iteration 1</th>
<th>Iteration 2</th>
<th>Iteration 3</th>
<th>Iteration 4</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Common Cold: 2</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>16</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>1918 Flu: 3</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>27</td>
<td>81</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Chickpox: 10</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>1000</td>
<td>10000</td>
</tr>

</table>

Update the `main` method in the **TransmissionRate* class to implement the following functionality:

1. Declare and initialize a `Scanner` to read input from the console.
2. Prompt for and read the transmission rate R<sub>0</sub> as an integer.
3. Call `Math.pow` to calculate the potential new cases at the 4th iteration
   based on the given R<sub>0</sub> value.
4. Use casting to convert the `double` value returned from `Math.pow` to an
   `int`.
5. Print the number of new cases as shown in the sample runs.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Sample Run#1</th>
<th>Sample Run#2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Enter r0: <b>2</b><br>
New cases on 4th iteration: 16
</td>
<td>Enter r0: <b>18</b><br>
New cases on 4th iteration: 104976
</td>

</tr>
</table>

Run **TransmissionRateTest** to confirm your solution passes the Junit tests.

## Task 2 - SeafoodMarket

**Objective**: Calculate the total cost of fish purchased based on the weight and price per pound, rounding the total to two decimal places.

Update the `main` method in the **SeafoodMarket* class to implement the following functionality:

1. Declare and initialize a `Scanner` to read input from the console.
2. Prompt for and read two doubles: (1) pounds of fish and (2) price per pound.
3. Calculate the total cost as a double, rounding the value to 2 digits after
   the decimal point.
4. Print the pounds, price per pound, and total cost as shown in the sample runs
   below.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Sample Run#1</th>
<th>Sample Run#2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Enter pounds of fish and price per pound: <b>5 8.99</b><br>
5.0 lbs at $8.99 per lb = $44.95
</td>
<td>Enter pounds of fish and price per pound: <b>3.25 15.99</b><br>
3.25 lbs at $15.99 per lb = $51.97
</td>

</tr>
</table>

Run **SeafoodMarketTest** to confirm your solution passes the Junit tests.

# Task 3 - NearestInt

**Objective**: Demonstrate how to convert a fraction into a double and round it to the nearest integer, including handling negative values.

Update the `main` method in the **NearestInt** class to implement the following functionality:

1. Declare and initialize a `Scanner` to read input from the console.
2. Prompt for and read two ints: (1) numerator and (2) denominator.
3. Print the numeric conversions displayed in the sample runs. Hint: subtract
   0.5 when rounding to the nearest negative int.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Sample Run#1</th>
<th>Sample Run#2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Enter numerator and denominator: <b>19 4</b><br>
Fraction: 19/4<br>
Double Value: 4.75<br>
Cast as Int: 4<br>
Rounded to nearest int: 5<br>
Negative Value: -4.75<br>
Negative Value rounded to nearest int: -5
</td>
<td>Enter numerator and denominator: <b>11 8</b><br>
Fraction: 11/8<br>
Double Value: 1.375<br>
Cast as Int: 1<br>
Rounded to nearest int: 1<br>
Negative Value: -1.375<br>
Negative Value rounded to nearest int: -1<br>
</td>

</tr>
</table>

## Task 4 - BasketBallGame

**Objective**: Simulate the progression of a basketball game by updating scores after each quarter based on specific instructions.

The `main` method in the **BasketBallGame** class prompts for the home and away scores for the first quarter,
initializes variables to store each team's score, and prints the scores for the
1st quarter.

Your task is to update the code for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarters based on the
instructions given in the comments.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Sample Run#1</th>
<th>Sample Run#2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Home and away points for 1st quarter: <b>25 20</b><br>
1st quarter scores: home 25 away 20<br>
2nd quarter scores: home 50 away 50<br>
After challenge: home 47 away 50<br>
3rd quarter scores: home 57 away 62<br>
After challenge: home 58 away 62<br>
4th quarter scores: home 82 away 81
</td>
<td>
Home and away points for 1st quarter: <b>30 22</b><br>
