/**
 * The CustomerServiceChatBot class simulates a simple text-based chatbot
 * that provides basic customer service responses based on user input.
 * 
 * The chatbot continuously prompts the user for input until they type "bye" or
 * "exit". It analyzes the user's message using a set of keyword-based rules to
 * generate responses:
 * 
 * Rules:
 * - If the message contains "problem" or "issue", the chatbot expresses
 * sympathy.
 * - If the message contains "shipping", it provides shipping details.
 * - If the message contains "return", it explains the return policy.
 * - For all other messages (that are not "bye"/"exit"), it asks for more
 * details.
