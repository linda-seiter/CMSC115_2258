/**
 * The SalesAssistant class tracks daily sales and provides feedback on progress
 * toward a sales target.
 * 
 * The program prompts for a sales target and the number of days for tracking.
 * Using a for loop, it collects daily sales input, calculates cumulative sales,
 * average daily sales, and predicts the total sales by the end of the period.
 * 
 * Based on the progress, the program provides feedback on whether the target is
 * achievable or at risk. At the end of the tracking period, a final message
 * indicates if the target was met.
