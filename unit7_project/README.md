# Unit 7 Project - Physical Training Performance Analyzer

## **Objective**
In this lab, you will develop a **Physical Training (PT) Performance Analyzer** using **1D arrays** in Java. You will:
- Collect and store **PT performance data** for soldiers.
- Compute and display **maximum, minimum, and average** statistics for each exercise.
- Encode each soldierâ€™s **pass/fail status** based on performance thresholds.
- Create modular, clean, and well-organized code using reusable methods to achieve a final outcome.

This lab will reinforce your understanding of **arrays, loops, methods, string formatting, and basic statistics.**


## Introduction

You will develop several methods within the **PTPerformanceAnalyzer** class
to work with 1D arrays.

The `main` method .....

## **Getting Started**
- Use **Scanner** for user input.
- Do **not** use Java Streams or advanced data structures.
- Do not use methods from the Java `Array` or `Arrays` classes except for the `Arrays.toString()` method.
- Follow **incremental task-based development**.
